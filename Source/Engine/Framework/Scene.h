    /// <summary>
    /// Container and manager for all actors within a game level or area.
    /// 
    /// The Scene class serves as the primary container for objects (Actors) and provides
    /// the main game loop functionality (update, draw) for all contained entities. It extends
    /// Object to support serialization, enabling level data to be loaded from configuration files.
    /// 
    /// Key Responsibilities:
    /// - Actor lifecycle management (creation, update, destruction)
    /// - Coordinated updating of all active actors each frame
    /// - Rendering coordination for all visible actors
    /// - Factory integration for loading actors from serialized data
    /// - Prototype registration for efficient actor spawning
    /// - Query interface for finding specific actors or actor types
    /// 
    /// Design Philosophy:
    /// - Centralized management: Single point of control for all actors in a scene
    /// - Data-driven loading: Scenes can be completely defined in external files
    /// - Performance-focused: Efficient iteration and selective processing
    /// - Type-safe queries: Template-based actor retrieval with compile-time type checking
    /// - Memory ownership: Clear ownership model using unique_ptr for automatic cleanup
    /// 
    /// Common Usage Patterns:
    /// 1. **Level Loading**: Load entire scenes from JSON configuration files
    /// 2. **Game Loop Integration**: Update and draw all actors in coordinated fashion
    /// 3. **Actor Management**: Add/remove actors dynamically during gameplay
    /// 4. **Object Queries**: Find specific actors for interaction or game logic
    /// 5. **Prototype Systems**: Register actor templates for efficient spawning
    /// 
    /// Example Scene Structure:
    /// ```json
    /// {
    ///     "name": "Level1",
    ///     "prototypes": [
    ///         {"name": "EnemyTemplate", "type": "Enemy", ...},
    ///         {"name": "PickupTemplate", "type": "Pickup", ...}
    ///     ],
    ///     "actors": [
    ///         {"name": "Player", "type": "Player", "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0}},
    ///         {"name": "Enemy1", "prototype": "EnemyTemplate", ...}
    ///     ]
