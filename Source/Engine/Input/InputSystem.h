    /// Input management system providing centralized handling of keyboard and mouse input.
    /// 
    /// This system wraps SDL3 input functionality and provides a consistent, frame-based
    /// input interface for the game engine. It maintains both current and previous frame
    /// input states, enabling detection of press/release events and input state changes.
    /// 
    /// Key Features:
    /// - Frame-based input state management with current/previous state tracking
    /// - Keyboard input handling using SDL scancodes for layout-independent keys
    /// - Mouse button and position tracking with delta movement calculation
    /// - Event-style input detection (pressed this frame, released this frame)
    /// - Consistent API for both polling and event-based input patterns
    /// 
    /// Design Philosophy:
    /// - Centralizes all input handling in one system for consistency
    /// - Provides both immediate state queries and event-style detection
    /// - Uses fixed-size arrays for optimal performance and memory usage
    /// - Maintains frame coherency by updating all input state together
    /// 
    /// Usage Patterns:
    /// - Query continuous input states (movement, held buttons)
    /// - Detect single-frame events (button presses, releases)
    /// - Track mouse movement and position for camera or UI interaction
    /// - Integrate with game systems that need frame-consistent input data
    /// 
    /// Thread Safety:
    /// - This system should only be updated from the main thread
    /// - Input queries are safe to call from multiple threads after Update()
    /// - SDL input functions are called only during Update() for thread safety
